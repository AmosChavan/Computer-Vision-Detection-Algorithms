# Computer-Vision-Detection-Algorithms
This repository contains a collection of computer vision detection algorithms implemented from scratch. These implementations demonstrate my approach to understanding and applying fundamental concepts in computer vision, using techniques for object detection, feature extraction, and image processing.
# Contents
## Object Detection: 
Code for detecting objects in images or video streams using classical algorithms.
## Feature Extraction: 
Implementations of various methods for extracting and matching features in images.
## Image Processing: 
Algorithms for pre-processing and enhancing images, such as edge detection, image filtering, and segmentation.
## Optimization Techniques: 
Approaches used to improve detection accuracy and computational efficiency.
## Technologies and Libraries
The codes are written in C++ and leverage OpenCV for image processing and computer vision tasks.
